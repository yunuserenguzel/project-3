</p>



<h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
<p><strong>Information Collected Upon Registration: </strong>When you create or reconfigure a Sonicraph account, you provide some personal information, such as your name, username, password, and email address. Some of this information, for example, your name and username, is listed publicly on our Services, including on your profile page and in search results.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Information:</strong> You may provide us with profile information to make public, such as your location, your website or a picture. You may provide information to customize your account, such as Date of Birth or your Gender. We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services or to market to you. We may use your contact information to help others find your Sonicraph account, including through third-party services and client applications. We may later suggest people to follow on Sonicraph based on your location and follower and/or following list. If you email us, we may keep your message, email address and contact information to respond to your request.
</p>
<p><strong>Sonics, Following and other Public Information:</strong> Our Services are primarily designed to help you share information with the world. Most of the information you provide us is information you are asking us to make public. This includes not only the sonics you post and the metadata provided with Sonics, such as when you posted the people you follow, the sonics you mark as favorites or Resoniced, and many other bits of information that result from your use of the Services. Our default is almost always to make the information you provide public for as long as you do not delete it from Sonicraph. Your public information is broadly and instantly disseminated. When you share information or content as a Sonic you should think carefully about what you are making public.</p>
<p><strong>Location Information:</strong> You may choose to publish your location in your Sonics and in your Sonicraph profile. You can set your location preferences in your Account settings. We may use and store information about your location to provide features of our Services, such as Posting  with your location, and to improve and customize the Services, for example, with more relevant content like local trends, stories, ads, and suggestions for people to follow.
</p>
<p><strong>Links:</strong> Sonicraph may keep track of how you interact with links across our Services, including our email notifications, third-party services, and client applications, by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help improve our Services, to provide more relevant advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.</p>
<p><strong>Third-Parties:</strong> Sonicraph uses a variety of third-party services to help provide our Services to help us understand the use of our Services, such as Google Analytics. These third-party service providers may collect information sent by your Mobile devices as part of a web page request, such as cookies or your IP address. Third-party ad partners may share information with us, like a browser cookie ID or cryptographic hash of a common account identifier (such as an email address), to help us measure ad quality and tailor ads.</p>


<h3>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>

<p><strong>Your Consent:</strong> We may share or disclose your information at your direction, such as when you authorize a third-party web client or application to access your Sonicraph account.</p>
<p><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We engage service providers to perform functions and provide services to us in your country and abroad. We may share your private personal information with such service providers subject to confidentiality obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy, and on the condition that the third parties use your private personal data only on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions.</p>
<p><strong>Law and Harm:</strong> Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Policy, we may preserve or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect Sonicraph's rights or property. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party’s, including a government’s, request to disclose your information.</p>
<p><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In the event that Sonicraph is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. The promises in this Privacy Policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity.</p>
<p><strong>Non-Private or Non-Personal Information:</strong> We may share or disclose your non-private, aggregated or otherwise non-personal information, such as your public user profile information, public Sonics, the people you follow or that follow you, or the number of users who clicked on a particular link (even if only one did).</p>

<h3> Our Policy Towards Children</h3>
<p>Our Services are not directed to persons under 13. If you become aware that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us at <a href="mailto: support@sonicraph.com" target="_blank">support@sonicraph.com</a> We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

</p>

<h3>Changes to this Policy</h3>
<p>We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the policy will govern our use of your information and will always be at <a href="/about/privacy">sonicraph.com/about/privacy</a>.
